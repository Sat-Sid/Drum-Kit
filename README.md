Click on each buttons or use keyboard keys to have respective drum sound.

Added Event Listeners to each buttons to listen to either keyboard press or mouse clicks and produce their respective drum sounds.
Have come across:
  Higher order function (function which has fnction within it. ex: addEventListeners())
  Constructor function (which is useful in creating multiple objects)
  Creating objects (adding sound)
  Creating methods (adding sound)
  Switch statements
  setTimeout() methods (for adding delay)
